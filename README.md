### 1. Concept

Our first task is to show a list of People records that are available via the SalesLoft API.  Display each Personâ€™s name, email address, and job title. 

### 2. Process


To get setup, I  installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and the node package manager better known as npm. Then I installed Express Generator with `npm install -g express-generator`. To create the project `testApp` I type `express testApp`. 
 
 
 Currently, you can go to [http://localhost:3000/people/peoplelist](http://localhost:3000/people/peoplelist) to see the JSON output that we'll manipulate.
 
### 3. Challenges and successes

- It took a few moments for me to realize that I could not or should not use the API key as a uri query parameter. Thankfully, I used [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/), an API development environment, to play around with different GET requests before building the app. 

- At first, in `routes/people.js` I used `res.render` to output JSON to the `people.jade` template. When I moved on to Level Two, I realized that, with my current set up, I would have to make another GET request. That seemed repetitive. Using `res.json` allows me to make one GET request and use its JSON response elsewhere in my app.

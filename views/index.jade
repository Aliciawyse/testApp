  // USER LIST
  #userList
    h2 Level 1: Show a list of People records available via the API.  Display each Person’s name, email address, and job title.
    table.table.is-bordered.is-striped.is-fullwidth
      thead
        th first_name
        th email_address
        th job_title
      tbody
   // /USER LIST

  // CHARACTER FREQUENCY
  h2 Level 2: Create a button that, when clicked, displays a frequency count of all the unique characters in all the email addresses of all the People you have access to, sorted by frequency count (the count below).

  button(onclick='populateTable()').button.is-success.is-large Show me!
  #hidden
    #characterFrequency
      table.table.is-bordered.is-striped.is-fullwidth
        thead
          th character
          th count
        tbody
   // /CHARACTER FREQUENCY

  // POTENTIAL DUPLICATES
  h2 Level 3:  Create a 2nd button that would show us a list of suggested possible duplicate People. A human can tell that “benoliv@salesloft.com” and “benolive@salesloft.com” are very likely the same person with just one of the email addresses having a typo. A computer can tell that those emails are very likely the same person with code that checks if two strings are one replacement, insertion or removal away from each other. For example...

  p You could replace a character in "bale" to make "pale". They are different only in one place.

  p The strings "apple" and "aple" are one insertion away. These strings are identical except for a shift at the some point in the string.

  p The strings "apple" and "aple" are also one removal away. Removal is the opposite of insertion.
